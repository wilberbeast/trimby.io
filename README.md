# trimby.io
The respository for the open source, community based, python coded robot lawn mower.

# Background and Reasoning
Robotics is interesting and increasingly accessible, but it is important to have a purpose and long term aim for a project. Thus, a robot lawn mower, which incorporates many aspects of robotics, has many interesting challenges, but fundamentally is useful to a large proportion of the population.
A robot lawn mower is also small enough such that most of the components can be 3D printed or sourced cheaply online.

# Functional Requirements
The following are the desires for the final output, i.e. what we want it to do.

## Primary
- Cuts grass
- Doesn’t cut non-grass
- Is safe
- Cuts all grass required, i.e. can move and navigate
- No boundary wires
- Battery operated - rechargeable
- Cheap

## Secondary
- Isn’t noisy
- Doesn’t get stuck, i.e. doesn't fall into the garden or pond, etc.
- Isn’t random path, i.e. it knows where it is and cuts in a deterministic fashion

## Tertiary
- Can automatically recharge

# Development Requirements
The following are the desires of the development process, i.e. what do we want to have fun doing.

## Primary
- All programming in Python (fun and accessible)
- All parts 3D-printed where possible
- Non 3D-printed parts are cheap and easily obtainable

## Secondary
- Multiple small cheap bots that coordinate - just for fun
